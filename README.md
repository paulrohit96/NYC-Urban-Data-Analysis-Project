# NYC Urban Data Analysis

NYC Urban Data Analysis Project
Overview:
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of New York City’s urban dynamics through three primary datasets: NYC Shooting Incidents, COVID-19 statistics, and Job Placements. Using Python and SQL, we explore patterns in public safety, public health, and employment to reveal insights about NYC.

 Key Objectives:
- Shooting Data: Analyze incident trends by location, time, and demographics to support public safety strategies.
- COVID-19 Data: Examine infection, hospitalization, and mortality trends to understand pandemic impacts on different regions.
- Job Placement Data: Evaluate job trends, salary benchmarks, and visa statuses for insights into NYC’s employment landscape.

Tools & Technologies
- Data Analysis: Python (pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, GeoPandas
- SQL: Complex queries for in-depth analysis

Data Preparation & Challenges:
Data was meticulously cleaned and standardized to handle missing values, outliers, and varying data formats. Challenges included aligning temporal and geospatial data across datasets, resolved using custom functions and time-series resampling.

Visualizations:
- Heatmaps of shooting and COVID-19 hotspots
- Line and bubble charts for pandemic trends and job distributions

Future Work:
We plan to implement machine learning models for predictive insights and create an interactive dashboard for real-time data exploration.
