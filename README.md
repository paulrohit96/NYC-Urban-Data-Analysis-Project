# NYC Urban Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of **New York City’s urban dynamics** by integrating and examining three major datasets:

- **NYC Shooting Incidents**
- **COVID-19 Statistics**
- **Job Placements**

Through exploratory data analysis, visualization, and data cleaning, we uncover patterns in **public safety**, **public health**, and **employment trends** using Python and SQL. This project aims to support informed decision-making across sectors.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

### 🔫 Shooting Incidents
- Analyze trends in incident counts by **location**, **time**, and **demographics**
- Identify **hotspots** and seasonal or neighborhood-level patterns
- Provide data-driven insights for **public safety strategies**

### 🦠 COVID-19 Data
- Track **infection**, **hospitalization**, and **mortality** rates over time
- Analyze disparities across **boroughs**, **zip codes**, and **age groups**
- Visualize pandemic waves and their impact on urban populations

### 💼 Job Placement Data
- Explore **job trends**, **salary benchmarks**, and **visa sponsorships**
- Examine hiring rates by **industry**, **employer**, and **region**
- Gain insights into NYC’s **post-pandemic employment recovery**

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Data Analysis**: `Python`, `pandas`, `NumPy`
- **Data Visualization**: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`, `GeoPandas`
- **Database Querying**: `SQL` (with complex joins, aggregations, and window functions)
- **Geospatial Analysis**: `GeoPandas`, mapping COVID and crime hotspots

---

## 🛠 Data Preparation & Challenges

- Addressed **missing values**, **outliers**, and **inconsistent formats**
- Aligned **temporal** and **geospatial** fields across datasets using:
  - Custom data cleaning functions
  - Time-series resampling
  - Coordinate standardization
- Ensured cross-dataset consistency for meaningful comparisons

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- **Heatmaps**: COVID-19 case and shooting incident hotspots
- **Time-Series Charts**: Infection, mortality, and job posting trends
- **Bubble Charts**: Employment distribution by company and visa status
- **Geo-Choropleths**: Borough-level analysis for all three domains

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- Integrate **machine learning models** to:
  - Predict crime patterns
  - Forecast infection rates
  - Estimate job demand
- Build an **interactive dashboard** using `Dash` or `Streamlit` for real-time exploration
